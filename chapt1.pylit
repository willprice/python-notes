When writing control structures there are many C idioms that can creep
into one's code. Try and avoid these with these nice python idioms!

  better = x <= y <= z

Look! Many comparisons, such concise!

When checking lots of things, try not to use the travesty that is:

  name = 'Will'
  if name == 'Will' or name == 'Dick' or name == 'Jim':
    print 'Hooray!'

but instead use the far nicer:

  if name in ('Will', 'Dick', 'Jim'):
    print 'Hooray!'
